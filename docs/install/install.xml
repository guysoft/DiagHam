<chapter name="How to install DiagHam">


<section name="basic installation">

    The installation procedure is quite standard. DiagHam has been tested on <a href="architectures.html">different architectures with different OSes</a>. AIX users please refer to this <a href="aixnote.html">specific installation procedure</a>.<br>
    <p>
      
      First download the latest version <a href="../download/index.html">here</a>. Unpack the tarball package as usual:
    <ul>
      <li><i>gunzip DiagHamxxxxxxxx.tgz</i></li>
      <li><i>tar -xvf DiagHamxxxxxxxx.tar</i></li>
    </ul>
    or<br>
    <i>tar -xzvf DiagHamxxxxxxxx.tar</i> (if supported by your <b>tar</b> version)
      Go into the DiagHam directory and run the configure file<br>
    <i>./configure</i><br>
    If no error happened, you can now compile the whole program with<br>
    <i>make</i> (use the -jx with x equal to the number of processors on your computers if x>1)<br>
    <p>
    The compilation process is quite long, you can go and drink a coffee. Now you are back from the coffee machine, the compilation shall be over. If you go in the subdirectories of <i>src/Program</i> and you shall find all the examples described in <a href="../documentation/index.html">the documentation</a> (and more).<br>
    <p>
      If you encounter any problem during the installation stage please first refer to the <a href="../faqs/index.html">faqs</a>. If you did't find any answer there, you can send a <a href="../bug/index.html">bug report</a>

<section name="advanced intallation option">

DiagHam offers the possibility to enable/disable some advanced functionalities or even some classes of physical problems. This kind of tuning can be done using the \program{configure} options. You can get a quick overview of all available options using \command{./configure -h}

<subsection name="MPI support">
DiagHam supports distributed computing using MPI. This option is disable by default. To enable the MPI support, use the \longoption{enble-mpi}. There is also other options to specify some particularities of your MPI local installation
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

</subsection>
 
<subsection name="LAPACK support">

DiagHam can rely on the LAPACK libraries to do some linear algebra operations. In general; LAPACK functions are faster than their build-in DiagHam counterpart and are pehaps also more robust. LAPACK support is disable by default and can be enabled using the \longoption{enable-lapack} option. There is also some specific options in order to indicate some particularities of your LAPACK local installation.

\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

</subsection>
 
<subsection name="disable packages">

By default; all supported classes of physical problems are compiled. The compilation can thus be quite long. If you are only interested in a particular class of problems, you can disable all the other. Here is the list of possible options to do so :
